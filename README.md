# Hapi Login

A ***Complete Login Solution*** for **Hapi.js** Apps/APIs to get you
***up and running*** in the next ***5 minutes***.

## Why?

Letting people login to your App/API is *essential* any time
there is personalized content/functionality to display.

We needed a *easy* way of doing Login/Authentication for our projects
that we could drop into any project and be up-and running in minutes
and thus avoid people re-inventing the wheel too often.

After much research and investigation, we decided to use a few *existing*
**Hapi** modules together to form a re-useable starter package.

## What?

Login for Hapi Apps/APIs which gives you a set of routes
and a predictable usage pattern.

### Tested

Our *objective* is to *extensively* test every aspect of this package
so that we can *rely* on the package for our *high-traffic/security* projects.
