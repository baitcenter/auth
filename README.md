# Hapi Login

A ***Complete Login Solution*** for **Hapi.js** Apps/APIs to get you
***up and running*** in the next ***5 minutes***.

## Why?

Letting people login to your App/API is *essential* any time
there is personalized content/functionality to display.

We needed a *easy* way of doing Login/Authentication for our projects
that we could drop into any project and be up-and running in minutes
and thus avoid people re-inventing the wheel too often.

After much research and investigation, we decided to use a few *existing*
**Hapi** modules together to form a re-useable starter package.

## What?

Login for Hapi Apps/APIs which gives you a set of routes
and a predictable usage pattern.

### Tested

Our *objective* is to *extensively* test every aspect of this package
so that we can *rely* on the package for our *high-traffic/security* projects.

If you spot any area for improvement, please create an issue:
https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-login/issues so we can discuss!

## How?

As the name suggests, this plugin is built for apps built with the  [Hapi.js](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi) web framework.  
If you or *anyone* on your team are new to Hapi, we
have an **introductory tutorial**: https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-hapi




### Dependencies

+ [**hapi-auth-basic**](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi-auth-basic) -
we use the "*standard*" package for username & password style authentication.
+ [**bell**](https://github.com/hapijs/bell) - powers the Google, Facebook,
Twitter & LinkedIn Authentication
+ [**hapi-auth-jwt2**](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2) -
lets us track the session for people who have logged in and
identify (*authorise*) people returning to the site/app using a
[JSON Web Token](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens)
